Its Duncan Bannertime!


## Usage

Use `gulp` to automatically launch the banner into the browser with browsersync all your changes will be reflected in the browser with each file save.

Use `gulp prod` to generate a ZIP file of all the assets of the banner, these will all have been minified as well.

Use `gulp backup-gen` to automatically generate backup images for each banner.

### Creating Elements

You can create DOM elements using the the `smartObject` function, this will initialise a `<div>` with the default style of: `position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;`.

You are able to set a background image, or set a nested image as a `<img>` element.

There are helper functions such as `center`, `centerHorizontal` and `centerVertical` to help you position the element.

Other settings are set using a helper function on the element which uses GSAP to process. So `this.logo.set({autoAlpha: 0, scale: 0.4});` is the same as `TweenLite.set(this.logo, {autoAlpha: 0, scale: 0.4});`

### Animating

The banner animation is run by the `animate` function.

By default we are using TweenLite with TimelineLite, but you can change which flavour of GSAP as you require.
